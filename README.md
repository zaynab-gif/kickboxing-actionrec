> Multiple Model Action Recognition Techniques using Deep Learning for Kickboxing

In sports, athlete motion relates directly to form and performance. Video analysis is becoming a key aspect of monitoring and improving athlete performance; It is usual for coaches to take amateur videoand perform manual post-analysis. Recent steps have been taken to semi-automate this process. In these cases, there are repeatable actions by the athlete that form the key-frames of interest for further analysis. This project investigates the use of action recognition using deep learning techniques to produce a robust classification architecture for sport video analysis of dominant gestures.
