# Multiple Model Action Recognition Techniques using Deep Learning for Kickboxing

In sports, athlete motion is directly related to form and performance. Video analysis has become an essential tool for monitoring and improving athlete performance. Coaches typically record amateur videos and manually analyze them. Recent advancements have been made to semi-automate this process, focusing on identifying keyframes that highlight repetitive actions performed by the athlete.  

This project investigates action recognition using deep learning techniques to build a robust classification architecture for sports video analysis.  

## üî• Project Goals  
This project aims to develop a **robust 3D HPE-based action recognition system**, leveraging state-of-the-art techniques to achieve **real-time, high-accuracy detection** of kickboxing combat gestures. To achieve this, a **curated dataset** of kickboxing-specific gestures was developed and used to train 2 deep learning classifiers.  

## üöÄ Key Features  
‚úîÔ∏è 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) using MediaPipe BlazePose for action recognition  
‚úîÔ∏è Multi-model classification for robust gesture detection (Conv1D, LSTM)  
‚úîÔ∏è Curated dataset of kickboxing-specific movements  
‚úîÔ∏è Real-time detection with deep learning models
